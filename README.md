# Frontend Mentor - Easybank landing page

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges allow you to improve your skills in a real-life workflow.


## The challenge

My challenge was to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible. The challenge
required a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.


Users that visit the site can:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page


## Where to find everything

The task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design to work to. 

The designs are in JPG static format. This will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. This should help train your eye to perceive differences in spacings and sizes.
